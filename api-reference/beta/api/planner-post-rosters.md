### Errors

#### 403 Forbidden

If labels are mandatory for the user, and the created roster would have no sensitivity label, the request will fail, and the **code** property of the error resource type will be "SensitivityLabelsAreMandatory".

If the roster would be created with guest members initially added to the roster, but the proposed sensitivityLabel disallows the addition of guest users, the request will fail, and the **code** property on the error resource type will be "AddingGuestUsersProhibitedByLabel"
